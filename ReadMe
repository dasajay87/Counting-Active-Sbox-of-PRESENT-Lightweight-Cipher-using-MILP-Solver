I hope, you have successfully install Gurobi Software in Ubuntu

//PRESENT LightWeight Cipher
I have attached the c program file "present.c". Just run it and dump the output at "present.lp" file.
Here is the commands

	gcc present.c
	./a.out>present.lp

You can create .lp file (MILP code) for any number of ROUNDS written in C program for PRESENT.
Just change number of ROUNDS written in c program and run the file.


//start gurobi


gurobi.sh

Then open new terminal and run the .lp file you have created.

//To Run .lp file (here we can only see the final output only).
 gurobi_cl present.lp
 
 //To get all solution from .lp file
 gurobi_cl ResultFile=present.sol present.lp


For any doubts, please feel free to contact me. I will feel happy to share knowledge with you.
